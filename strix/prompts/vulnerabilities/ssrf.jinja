<title>SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF)</title>

<critical>SSRF enables the server to reach networks and services the attacker cannot. Focus on cloud metadata endpoints, service meshes, Kubernetes, and protocol abuse to turn a single fetch into credentials, lateral movement, and sometimes RCE.</critical>

<scope>
- Outbound HTTP/HTTPS fetchers (proxies, previewers, importers, webhook testers)
- Non-HTTP protocols via URL handlers (gopher, dict, file, ftp, smb wrappers)
- Service-to-service hops through gateways and sidecars (envoy/nginx)
- Cloud and platform metadata endpoints, instance services, and control planes
</scope>

<methodology>
1. Identify every user-influenced URL/host/path across web/mobile/API and background jobs. Include headers that trigger server-side fetches (link previews, analytics, crawler hooks).
2. Establish a quiet oracle first (OAST DNS/HTTP callbacks). Then pivot to internal addressing (loopback, RFC1918, link-local, IPv6, hostnames) and protocol variations.
3. Enumerate redirect behavior, header propagation, and method control (GET-only vs arbitrary). Test parser differentials across frameworks, CDNs, and language libraries.
4. Target high-value services (metadata, kubelet, Redis, FastCGI, Docker, Vault, internal admin panels). Chain to write/exec primitives if possible.
</methodology>

<injection_surfaces>
- Direct URL params: url=, link=, fetch=, src=, webhook=, avatar=, image=
- Indirect sources: Open Graph/link previews, PDF/image renderers, server-side analytics (Referer trackers), import/export jobs, webhooks/callback verifiers
- Protocol-translating services: PDF via wkhtmltopdf/Chrome headless, image pipelines, document parsers, SSO validators, archive expanders
- Less obvious: GraphQL resolvers that fetch by URL, background crawlers, repository/package managers (git, npm, pip), calendar (ICS) fetchers
</injection_surfaces>

<cloud_and_platforms>
<aws>
- IMDSv1: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ → {% raw %}/iam/security-credentials/{role}{% endraw %}, {% raw %}/user-data{% endraw %}
- IMDSv2: requires token via PUT {% raw %}/latest/api/token{% endraw %} with header {% raw %}X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds{% endraw %}, then include {% raw %}X-aws-ec2-metadata-token{% endraw %} on subsequent GETs. If the sink cannot set headers or methods, fallback to other targets or seek intermediaries that can
- ECS/EKS task credentials: {% raw %}http://169.254.170.2$AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI{% endraw %}
</aws>

<gcp>
- Endpoint: http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/
- Required header: {% raw %}Metadata-Flavor: Google{% endraw %}
- Target: {% raw %}/instance/service-accounts/default/token{% endraw %}
</gcp>

<azure>
- Endpoint: http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01
- Required header: {% raw %}Metadata: true{% endraw %}
- MSI OAuth: {% raw %}/metadata/identity/oauth2/token{% endraw %}
</azure>

<kubernetes>
- Kubelet: 10250 (authenticated) and 10255 (deprecated read-only). Probe {% raw %}/pods{% endraw %}, {% raw %}/metrics{% endraw %}, exec/attach endpoints
- API server: https://kubernetes.default.svc/. Authorization often needs the service account token; SSRF that propagates headers/cookies may reuse them
- Service discovery: attempt cluster DNS names (svc.cluster.local) and default services (kube-dns, metrics-server)
</kubernetes>
</cloud_and_platforms>

<internal_targets>
- Docker API: http://localhost:2375/v1.24/containers/json (no TLS variants often internal-only)
- Redis/Memcached: dict://localhost:11211/stat, gopher payloads to Redis on 6379
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
- Message brokers/admin UIs: RabbitMQ, Kafka REST, Celery/Flower, Jenkins crumb APIs
- FastCGI/PHP-FPM: gopher://localhost:9000/ (craft records for file write/exec when app routes to FPM)
</internal_targets>

<protocol_exploitation>
<gopher>
- Speak raw text protocols (Redis/SMTP/IMAP/HTTP/FCGI). Use to craft multi-line payloads, schedule cron via Redis, or build FastCGI requests
</gopher>

<file_and_wrappers>
- file:///etc/passwd, file:///proc/self/environ when libraries allow file handlers
- jar:, netdoc:, smb:// and language-specific wrappers (php://, expect://) where enabled
</file_and_wrappers>

<parser_and_filter_bypasses>
<address_variants>
- Loopback: 127.0.0.1, 127.1, 2130706433, 0x7f000001, ::1, [::ffff:127.0.0.1]
- RFC1918/link-local: 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16; test IPv6-mapped and mixed-notation forms
</address_variants>

<url_confusion>
- Userinfo and fragments: http://internal@attacker/ or http://attacker#@internal/
- Scheme-less/relative forms the server might complete internally: //169.254.169.254/
- Trailing dots and mixed case: internal. vs INTERNAL, Unicode dot lookalikes
</url_confusion>

<redirect_behavior>
- Allowlist only applied pre-redirect: 302 from attacker → internal host. Test multi-hop and protocol switches (http→file/gopher via custom clients)
</redirect_behavior>

<header_and_method_control>
- Some sinks reflect or allow CRLF-injection into the request line/headers; if arbitrary headers/methods are possible, IMDSv2, GCP, and Azure become reachable
</header_and_method_control>

<blind_and_mapping>
- Use OAST (DNS/HTTP) to confirm egress. Derive internal reachability from timing, response size, TLS errors, and ETag differences
- Build a port map by binary searching timeouts (short connect/read timeouts yield cleaner diffs)
</blind_and_mapping>

<chaining>
- SSRF → Metadata creds → cloud API access (list buckets, read secrets)
- SSRF → Redis/FCGI/Docker → file write/command execution → shell
- SSRF → Kubelet/API → pod list/logs → token/secret discovery → lateral
</chaining>

<validation>
1. Prove an outbound server-initiated request occurred (OAST interaction or internal-only response differences).
2. Show access to non-public resources (metadata, internal admin, service ports) from the vulnerable service.
3. Where possible, demonstrate minimal-impact credential access (short-lived token) or a harmless internal data read.
4. Confirm reproducibility and document request parameters that control scheme/host/headers/method and redirect behavior.
</validation>

<false_positive_indicators>
These responses typically indicate FALSE POSITIVES - not actual SSRF:

CLIENT-SIDE ONLY FETCHES (NOT SSRF):
- JavaScript/browser making the request (check Network tab vs server logs)
- No server-side activity in OAST callback timestamps
- Request originates from user's IP, not server's IP
- Image/iframe loaded client-side without server proxy

STRICT ALLOWLIST ENFORCED (NOT EXPLOITABLE):
- "Invalid URL" or "URL not allowed" error messages
- "Domain not in allowlist" responses
- Consistent error regardless of internal/external URLs
- DNS resolution blocked for non-allowed domains

NO EGRESS/BLOCKED (NOT EXPLOITABLE):
- Same error response for all targets (internal and external)
- Network timeout without any OAST callback
- Firewall/security group blocking outbound connections
- No difference between 127.0.0.1 and external domains

MOCK/SIMULATOR RESPONSES (NOT REAL SSRF):
- Generic "Resource fetched" without actual content
- Same response body regardless of URL parameter
- Testing environment with canned responses
- Sandbox without real network access

URL VALIDATION BYPASSES THAT DON'T WORK:
- Parser rejects malformed URLs before fetch
- Redirects are not followed
- Protocol scheme is strictly validated (only https://)
- Port restrictions enforced (only 80/443)

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ Did you receive an OAST callback FROM THE SERVER (not your browser)?
□ Can you access internal addresses (127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254)?
□ Is there evidence of server-side request (different response for internal vs external)?
□ Can you access metadata endpoints or internal services?
□ Are redirects followed by the server?

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR VALID SSRF:
1. OAST callback showing server IP (not client IP) made the request
2. Different responses for internal vs external URLs
3. Successful access to metadata endpoint or internal service
4. Response content from internal resource
5. Proof that the SERVER made the request, not the client

FALSE POSITIVE SCENARIOS:
- "Got callback" → Verify it's from server IP, not browser
- "URL parameter accepts any value" → Does it actually FETCH the URL?
- "Error with internal IP" → Is it a different error than with external IPs?
- "Image loaded" → Was it server-side proxy or client-side img tag?
</false_positive_indicators>

<impact>
- Cloud credential disclosure with subsequent control-plane/API access
- Access to internal control panels and data stores not exposed publicly
- Lateral movement into Kubernetes, service meshes, and CI/CD
- RCE via protocol abuse (FCGI, Redis), Docker daemon access, or scriptable admin interfaces
</impact>

<pro_tips>
1. Prefer OAST callbacks first; then iterate on internal addressing and protocols.
2. Test IPv6 and mixed-notation addresses; filters often ignore them.
3. Observe library/client differences (curl, Java HttpClient, Node, Go); behavior changes across services and jobs.
4. Redirects are leverage: control both the initial allowlisted host and the next hop.
5. Metadata endpoints require headers/methods; verify if your sink can set them or if intermediaries add them for you.
6. Use tiny payloads and tight timeouts to map ports with minimal noise.
7. When responses are masked, diff length/ETag/status and TLS error classes to infer reachability.
8. Chain quickly to durable impact (short-lived tokens, harmless internal reads) and stop there.
</pro_tips>

<remember>Any feature that fetches remote content on behalf of a user is a potential tunnel to internal networks and control planes. Bind scheme/host/port/headers explicitly or expect an attacker to route through them.</remember>
